# Sp4e Assignments

# Homework 2

## Description
Repository containing the second assignment for MATH-611: Scientific Programming for Engineers. The goal of this exercise is to get familiar with the concepts related to object oriented programming in C++.

## Requirements
Minimum requirements and compile options are listed below:
For C++:
- cmake_minimum_required (VERSION 2.8.11)
- add_compile_options(-std=c++14)
For Python:
- numpy v.1.23.4
- matplotlib v.3.6.1
- csv v.1.0

## Usage
### The HW2 directory contains the following structure:
HW2/
- src/ # Contains .hh and .cc files
    - ```CMakeLists.txt:``` contains the executable file names to run CMake
    - ```main.cc:``` main code where all the exercises can be run
    - ```ComputeArithmetic.{cc,hh}:``` computes the terms and summation of the arithmetic series (Exercise 2)
    - ```ComputePi.{cc,hh}:``` computes the terms and summation of the pi series (Exercise 2)
    - ```DumperSeries.hh:``` base class for the dumper series (Exercise 3)
    - ```PrintSeries.{cc,hh}:``` prints out the iteration number, result of the series and its convergence (Exercise 3) 
    - ```RiemannIntegral.{cc,hh}:``` calculates the discretized integral of a given function for a specific interval (Exercise 6)
    - ```Series.{cc,hh}:``` base class for the series (Exercise 2)
    - ```WriteSeries.{cc,hh}:``` writes iteration number, series summation, and convergence into a file of given format (Exercise 3) 
- build/ # folder for compilation (not to be commited)
- ```plot_series.py:``` Loads the results saved in Ex. 5 in any foramt (.psv, .csv, or .txt) and plots them.  
- CMakeLists.txt
- .gitignore
- README.md

### Running the program
Runs the given problem with different choices for maximum iteration, frequency, series type, output option, and separator type.
- Series types are defined as: "arithmetic", "pi"
    - "arithmetic" for arithmetic series
    - "pi" for series converging towards pi
- Output options are defined as: "print", "write"
    - "print" results in printing on terminal
    - "write" results in generating an output file
- Separator types are defined as: "comma", "pipe", "space", "tab"
    - "comma" generates a .csv file
    - "pipe" generates a .psv file
    - "space" and "tab" generates a .txt file

Please change Run>Edit configurations>Program argument within the order of  maximum iteration, frequency, series type, output option, and separator type.
An example set of program arguments for maximum 100 iteration with frequency of 10 for pi series to printing on the screen.
```cpp
"100" "10" "pi" "print" ""
```
An example set of program arguments for maximum 150 iteration with frequency of 20 for pi series to writing to an output file.
```cpp
"150" "20" "pi" "write" "comma"
```

To plot the numerical results saved by ```WriteSeries``` class, go to ```HW2``` directory and run:
```python
python plot_series.py --file_path output.csv
python plot_series.py --file_path output.psv
python plot_series.py --file_path output.txt
```
Sample output results after having run the Pi series are already given in the folder. If the command above is run on one of the sample data files, the resulting plot will be the following:

## Answers to the questions

**Exercise 2.1:** 
_What is the best way/strategy to divide the work among yourselves?_

After writing the base ```Series``` Class together, we divided the workload among us based on the series type. One of us wrote the code for computing the Pi series whereas the other implemented the arithmetic series. Since the implementation of the arithmetic series was relatively easier, that person also was responsible for testing and documenting the code. For the rest of the project, we followed a similar strategy: we allocated the Exercise 3 into Write and Print, so each could implement a class indepently. Then, the person who finished earlier continued with the documentation and testing.

**Exercise 5.1:** 
_Evaluate the global complexity of your program._
