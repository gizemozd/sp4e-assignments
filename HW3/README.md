# Sp4e Assignments

# Homework 3

## Description
Repository containing the third assignment for MATH-611: Scientific Programming for Engineers. The goal of this exercise is to use an external library made for scientific computing and adapt it to our needs through a wrapping interface. FFTW library is used to code a heat equation solver.

## Requirements
Minimum requirements and compile options are listed below:
For C++:
- cmake_minimum_required (VERSION 2.8.11)
- add_compile_options(-std=c++14)
- FFTW version 3.3.10
- GoogleTest v1.12.1

For Python:
- numpy v.1.23.4
- matplotlib v.3.6.1
- csv v.1.0

## Usage
### The HW3 directory contains the following structure:
<p align="center" >
<img src="HW3/figures/classHierarchy2.png" width="600" />
</p>

### Running the program
Build the program as the following: 
```
cd sp4e-assignments/HW3
mkdir build
cd build 
cmake ..
make
```
### Executing generate_input.py

### Executing heat_distribution.py


### Interface Implementation


### Solver Implementation
